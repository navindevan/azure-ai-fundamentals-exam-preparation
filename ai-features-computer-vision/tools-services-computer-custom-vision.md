In my earlier article [Feature of Computer Vision Workloads on Azure](https://github.com/navindevan/azure-ai-fundamentals-exam-preparation/blob/main/ai-features-computer-vision/feature-computer-vision-workloads.md) we explored the common workloads of Computer vision. Continuing this discussion on workloads, in this article will we are going to explore Tools and Services for Computer and Custom Vision.  

### Overview
In today's data-driven world, the ability to extract meaningful insights from visual data has become increasingly crucial across various industries. From automating tedious tasks to enabling innovative solutions, computer vision technology has emerged as a game-changer. Microsoft Azure, one of the leading cloud computing platforms, offers a comprehensive suite of tools and services for computer vision applications. In this article, we will explore the various computer and custom vision tools and services available on Azure.

### Azure Computer Vision
Azure Computer Vision is a cloud-based service that enables developers to extract valuable information from images and videos using advanced algorithms. It offers a wide range of functionalities, including image recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), object detection, and image analysis.

### Computer Vision Tools
Microsoft Azure offers the choice between the computer vision service and the broader cognitive service suite, which encompasses various functionalities. These services operate under a unified umbrella, each requiring a unique KEY and END POINT for access and utilization.

### Computer Vision Service
  +  Utilizes pretrained machine learning models
  +  Recognizes over 10K objects
  +  Generates automatic image captions and tags
  +  Conducts content moderation for adult, racy, or gory content
  +  Detects faces and performs text recognition

### Azure Custom Vision
Azure Custom Vision empowers developers to build custom image classification and object detection models without requiring extensive machine learning expertise. It provides an intuitive interface for training and deploying custom vision models tailored to specific use cases.

### Custom Vision Service
  +  The Custom Vision Service offers the capability to build and trian models for either classification or object detection tasks. 
  +  You can upload your own dataset containing images and corresponding classes for training. 
  +  Once trained, you can publish the model for personal or collaborative use. 
  +  It's worth noting that the service segregates the training and prediction processes into two distinct resources.

### Conclusion
Discovering Azure's tools for computer and custom vision. They make it easy to create smart solutions using images and videos, helping businesses innovate faster. In next article we will explore the fundamental of Facial Services part of computer vision.
