### Overview
In this article We will explore core concepts such as utterances, entities, and intents, providing examples to illustrate their application.

### Core Concepts of NLP

### Utterances
Utterances are the fundamental units of communication in NLP. They are the phrases or sentences that users input into an NLP system. Utterances can vary widely in complexity and formality, depending on the context in which they are used.

**Examples**
  +  **Simple Utterance:** "What's the weather today?"
  +  **Complex Utterance:** "Can you please book me a table for two at the Italian restaurant downtown for tomorrow evening?"
  +  **Informal Utterance:** "Hey, any good pizza places around here?"

### Entities
Entities are the specific pieces of information that are extracted from utterances. They provide context and detail that are essential for the NLP system to understand the user's request fully.

### Types of Entities
  +  **Predefined Entities:** Commonly recognized entities such as dates, times, numbers, currencies, and locations.
  +  **Custom Entities:** Specific to the application domain, such as product names, employee IDs, or technical terms.

**Examples**

In the utterance "What's the weather today in New York?" the entity is "New York" (location).
In "Book me a flight for next Friday," the entity is "next Friday" (date).
In "Transfer $200 to my savings account," the entities are "$200" (amount) and "savings account" (account type).

### Intents
Intents represent the underlying goal or purpose of an utterance. Identifying the intent allows the NLP system to determine what action to take in response to the user's input.

**Examples**

  +  **Weather Inquiry:** "What's the weather today?" (Intent: GetWeather).
  +  **Flight Booking:** "Book me a flight for next Friday." (Intent: BookFlight).
  +  **Money Transfer:** "Transfer $200 to my savings account." (Intent: TransferMoney).

### Conclusion
Understanding the core concepts of NLP—utterances, entities, and intents—is essential for developing effective language models that can accurately interpret and respond to user inputs.
